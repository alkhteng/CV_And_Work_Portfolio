# My Instructional Design Process & Portfolio

This portfolio showcases my end-to-end approach to creating effective learning experiences—from initial needs analysis and course design to development, delivery, and evaluation. I follow the ADDIE model to ensure a structured, learner-centered process while adapting to real-world constraints and opportunities.

You’ll find examples of my work here, including storyboards, course materials, and interactive modules. For additional samples, such as video tutorials and multimedia projects, feel free to explore my GitHub repository, https://github.com/alkhteng/Videos. 

I’d love to discuss how my skills align with your team’s needs—let’s connect.
